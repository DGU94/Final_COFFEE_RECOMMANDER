       "7039  For me this coffee lacks sufficient sweetness to support its attractive tobacco, spice and floral notes. Sweetness in dry-processed coffees like this one comes from sustained contact of the bean with ripe fruit during drying. The profile-flattening lack of sweetness here may derive from too many green or unripe cherries in the mix.   \n",

The sweetness, enlivened by spice and chocolate, almost sneaks out from under the hardness at the finish, but not quite.

       "7037  The Fazenda Vista Alegre estate processes their coffee by allowing it to dry on the tree, the ultimate in dry naturals. Satisfying body and richness, but little sweetness or nuance, due to either an over-aggressive roast or drying-related defect. \"Think global, roast local\" is the motto of City Bean Coffee, a two-store roaster in the Los Angeles area whose coffees have won an impressive variety of awards.

The aftertaste is astringent. Masters milk nicely. I want to attribute the sharpness in this assertive espresso blend to the high-grown arabicas and the flattened nuance on the robustas, but I suppose that the Brazil component could contribute to both as well. Robustas are not added to blends like this o   \n",

Though the wood smoke does not influence taste, it does encourage a slow roast. This coffee has attractive tobacco, spice and floral notes, but lacks sweetness. Mr. Espresso coffees are roasted in traditional Italian machines fired by oak. The wood smoke does not enter the roasting drum or influence taste, but the technology does encourage a slow, deliberate approach to roasting.   \n",

Body is round and creamy, but light. A Brazil-based blend incorporating a broad range of coffees. The exciting citrus tones probably come from a washed Ethiopia Yirgacheffe or Sidamo, but a citrus/floral taste occasionally surfaces in Brazils as well. Ink Coffee's best-selling blend.   \n",
