Goal of the project

The goal of the project is to design a coffee-recommender programme that offers users coffee suggestions by presenting them with three different options: a random coffee suggestion, the top five highest rated or budget coffees, and a custom selection that allows users to input some features that they value in a coffee (e.g. what flavours). The project covers data cleaning and analysis, clustering with Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the coding of the CoffeeCompass programme.
